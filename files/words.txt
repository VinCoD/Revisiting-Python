Creating a new programming language is a complex and time-consuming task that requires a deep understanding of language design and implementation. Here are some general steps you could follow to create a new programming language based on Python:

Define the goals and target audience for your language. What problems does your language aim to solve, and for whom is it intended? This will help you determine the features and syntax of your language.

Design the syntax and semantics of your language. Decide on the basic structure and layout of your code, including how statements and expressions are written, how variables and functions are defined, and how data types are represented.

Implement a parser for your language. A parser is a program that reads your source code and translates it into a form that can be executed by a computer. You can use a parser generator tool like ANTLR or Ply to create a parser for your language.

Implement a compiler or interpreter for your language. A compiler converts your source code into machine code that can be run directly on a computer's processor, while an interpreter reads and executes your code line by line. Depending on your goals and target audience, you may choose to implement either a compiler or an interpreter (or both).

Test and debug your language. Thoroughly test your language to ensure that it is correct and reliable. Use a debugger to find and fix any errors or bugs in your code.

Document your language. Create documentation for your language, including a reference manual, tutorials, and examples to help users learn and use your language effectively.

These are just a few of the steps involved in creating a new programming language. It is a challenging and rewarding process that requires a strong understanding of computer science and programming concepts.
